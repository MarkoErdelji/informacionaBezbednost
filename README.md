# Certificate generator
🔒 The Certificates Web App is a secure and efficient platform designed to create and manage certificates. It utilizes .NET 6 for the backend and React JS for the web frontend. This application enables users to easily generate, validate certificates, and perform related tasks.

🔐 To ensure data security, private keys are stored locally, while public certificate information is stored within the database. The app employs robust security features, including OAuth 2.0 for secure logins, password recovery, two-factor authentication (2FA), and regular password rotation.

📊 For activity monitoring and tracking, the app incorporates a logging system and efficiently manages user sessions. Enhanced security and communication are achieved through integration with ReCAPTCHAv3, SendGrid, and Twilio.

✅ Data integrity is maintained through rigorous validation procedures, guarding against common cyber threats such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and unauthorized access attempts.

## Backend

The Certificates Web App's backend is powered by .NET 6, delivering improved performance and modern features. A key component of our backend architecture is the use of the PostgreSQL database, providing strong and reliable data storage for the application. 🚀🔧

Our primary focus with this application is ensuring security. We've painstakingly incorporated robust security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Security protocols, including encryption, authentication, and authorization, are diligently implemented to safeguard user information and maintain the authenticity of the certificates managed within the system. 🔒🔐
